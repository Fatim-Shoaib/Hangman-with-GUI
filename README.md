# Hangman-with-GUI
READ TILL END TO SEE HOW TO RUN THE CODE
!! RUN THE main_screen.exe FILE TO RUN THE CODE, NOT THE main.exe FILE !!

Project: Hangman
- I created the famous game hangman. In the game, the program randomly chooses a word based on the difficulty selected by the user from a text file containing words sorted by word size. 
- I used the sfml library for graphics. I learnt about it using the following YouTube video:

- I also used file handling (for reading the file with words). I learnt this from the following website:
  https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_files.asp
- For sorting the file according to size of words, we used a Python script. The Python file is in this
  folder and is named sorting_words.py

NOTE:
- To run the code, run the main_screen.exe file in the same folder (since the folder contains the necessary 
  libraries and the text file with words needed for it to run.)
- Originally, I used ASCII art, so the functions in the main_screen.cpp file were origianlly meant to work without a GUI. The functions had to be modified to work properly with a GUI.
- All the images used were created completely from scratch in Photoshop, and the music and fonts used were not copyrighted at the time of installing them.
